## Important: Ngrok Warning Page

When you visit the public URL, you'll see ngrok's warning page. This is normal for the free tier.

### Alternative Access Methods:

#### Method 1: Direct Local Access
- Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8080`
- This bypasses ngrok entirely

#### Method 2: Use ngrok Web Interface
- Open: http://localhost:4040
- Click on the tunnel URL to access your app

#### Method 3: Accept Warning Once
- After accepting the warning page once, the app should work normally
- Clear browser cache if issues persist

## Troubleshooting

### If you see 503/500 errors:
1. Make sure the Vite dev server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Check local access: `http://localhost:8080`
3. Restart ngrok if needed: `pkill -f ngrok && ngrok http 8080`

### If resources fail to load:
1. Accept the ngrok warning page first
2. Check browser console for specific errors
3. Try accessing via localhost:8080 instead

## Current Status
- ✅ Vite dev server running on port 8080
- ✅ Ngrok tunnel active
- ✅ Application accessible locally
- ⚠️ Requires accepting ngrok warning page for public access

## Commands to Manage Tunnel

```bash
# Check tunnel status
curl http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels

# Restart ngrok
pkill -f ngrok
ngrok http 8080

# Check local server
curl http://localhost:8080
```

## Next Steps
1. Share the URL: https://c9f9-173-219-115-5.ngrok-free.app
2. Instruct users to accept the warning page
3. Test all features after accepting the warning
4. Consider upgrading to ngrok paid plan for no warning page
