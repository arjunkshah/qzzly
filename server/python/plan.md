# Project Plan (Updated for Deta Space)

## Current Status
- Backend (FastAPI + olmOCR) prepared for Deta Space deployment
- Dockerfile not needed for Deta Space
- Procfile removed (not used by Deta Space)
- FastAPI app exposed as 'app' in main.py for Deta Space compatibility

## Next Steps
1. Push backend code to GitHub (if not already)
2. Deploy to Deta Space via their dashboard (connect GitHub repo)
3. Get public backend URL from Deta Space
4. Update frontend .env with new backend URL
5. Rebuild and redeploy frontend

## Notes
- Deta Space does not require payment info
- 100% uptime for microservices
- No forced sleep
