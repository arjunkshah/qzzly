## Large PDF Ingestion Pipeline (Gemini API)

- **PDF Text Extraction**: Added `extractTextFromPDF` utility using `pdfjs-dist` to extract all text from uploaded PDF files.
- **Chunking**: Added `chunkText` utility to split extracted text into manageable chunks (default 4000 chars) for LLM context window limits.
- **File Upload Update**: Updated `FilesComponent.tsx` to extract and chunk PDF text on upload, storing `textChunks` in each `FileItem`.
- **Type Update**: Extended `FileItem` type to include `textChunks: string[]` for chunked text storage.
- **Gemini Service Update**: Updated `generateFlashcards` in `geminiService.ts` to process each chunk with Gemini, aggregate all flashcards, and deduplicate results.
- **Flashcard Generation Update**: Updated `FlashcardComponent.tsx` and `sessionService.ts` to pass files (with `textChunks`) to Gemini for chunked processing, ensuring large files are fully ingested.

**Files changed:**
- `src/lib/utils.ts` (PDF extraction, chunking)
- `src/types/session.ts` (FileItem type)
- `src/components/study/FilesComponent.tsx` (upload pipeline)
- `src/services/geminiService.ts` (chunked Gemini calls)
- `src/components/study/FlashcardComponent.tsx` (flashcard generation)
- `src/services/sessionService.ts` (Gemini integration)

**Result:**
- You can now upload large PDFs (e.g., 50+ pages). The app extracts and chunks the text, then generates flashcards from all content using Gemini, bypassing context window limits.
